### Loading libraries and data

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
library(mgcv)


knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

# Problem 1

Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to
factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).

``` r
birth_df = 
  read_csv("data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = recode_factor(babysex, `1` = "male", `2` = "female"),
    frace = recode_factor(frace, `1` = "white", `2` = "black", `3` = "asian", `4` = "puerto rican", `8` = "other", `9` = "unknown"),
    mrace = recode_factor(mrace, `1` = "white", `2` = "black", `3` = "asian", `4` = "puerto rican", `8` = "other", `9` = "unknown"),
    malform = recode_factor(malform, `0` = "absent", `1` = "present")
  )
```

    ## Rows: 4342 Columns: 20

    ## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (20): babysex, bhead, blength, bwt, delwt, fincome, frace, gaweeks, malf...

    ## 
    ## i Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## i Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
sum(is.na(birth_df))
```

    ## [1] 0

No missing observations

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two.
Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals
against fitted values – use add\_predictions and add\_residuals in
making this plot.

After doing some general research on known risk-factors of low birth
weight I will start to build a model by examining the effects of length
at birth, gestational age, sex, and cigarettes smoked on birth weight.

Based on the literature, I would also have included parity, number of
previous low birth weight babies, and number of previous small for
gestational age babies, but almost every value for parity is zero (total
previous births = 10 with range 0 - 6) and no observation in the sample
has a previous low birth weight or small for gestational age baby.

``` r
fit = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks + babysex + smoken, data = birth_df)

fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term          |  estimate | p.value |
|:--------------|----------:|--------:|
| (Intercept)   | -4296.099 |   0.000 |
| blength       |   127.431 |   0.000 |
| gaweeks       |    27.683 |   0.000 |
| babysexfemale |   -20.285 |   0.046 |
| smoken        |    -2.619 |   0.000 |

``` r
birth_df %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(fit) %>% 
  modelr::add_predictions(fit) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid, alpha = 0.3)) +
  geom_point()
```

Compare your model to two others:

-   One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
    effects only)

``` r
fit_2 = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birth_df)

fit_2 %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term        |  estimate | p.value |
|:------------|----------:|--------:|
| (Intercept) | -4347.667 |       0 |
| blength     |   128.556 |       0 |
| gaweeks     |    27.047 |       0 |

``` r
birth_df %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(fit_2) %>% 
  modelr::add_predictions(fit_2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid, alpha = 0.3)) +
  geom_point()
```

-   One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
    (including the three-way interaction) between these

``` r
fit_3 = lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead * blength + bhead * babysex + blength * babysex + blength * bhead * babysex, data = birth_df)

fit_3 %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term                        |  estimate | p.value |
|:----------------------------|----------:|--------:|
| (Intercept)                 | -7176.817 |   0.000 |
| bhead                       |   181.796 |   0.000 |
| blength                     |   102.127 |   0.000 |
| babysexfemale               |  6374.868 |   0.000 |
| bhead:blength               |    -0.554 |   0.478 |
| bhead:babysexfemale         |  -198.393 |   0.000 |
| blength:babysexfemale       |  -123.773 |   0.000 |
| bhead:blength:babysexfemale |     3.878 |   0.000 |

``` r
birth_df %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(fit_3) %>% 
  modelr::add_predictions(fit_3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid, alpha = 0.3)) +
  geom_point()
```

Make this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error;
use crossv\_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.

Note that although we expect your model to be reasonable, model building
itself is not a main idea of the course and we don’t necessarily expect
your model to be “optimal”.

# Problem 2

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```

The boostrap is helpful when you’d like to perform inference for a
parameter / value / summary that doesn’t have an easy-to-write-down
distribution in the usual repeated sampling framework. We’ll focus on a
simple linear regression with tmax as the response and tmin as the
predictor, and are interested in the distribution of two quantities
estimated from these data:

-   r^2

-   log(β<sup>0∗β</sup>1)

Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce
estimates of these two quantities. Plot the distribution of your
estimates, and describe these in words. Using the 5000 bootstrap
estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to provide a 95%
confidence interval for r^2 and log(β<sup>0∗β</sup>1). Note:
broom::glance() is helpful for extracting r^2 from a fitted regression,
and broom::tidy() (with some additional wrangling) should help in
computing log(β<sup>0∗β</sup>1).
